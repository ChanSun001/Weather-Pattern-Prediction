# Weather-Pattern-Prediction
Due to 2022 snow storm, this prompted me to think whether this was one of the largest snow storms in the history of my local city (Vancouver). <br />
Using online past 5 years weather dataset, I've created a cloud service data pipeline. AWS EMR with Spark and Hadoop, Pyspark script, and storing the logs in AWS S3 <br />
The goal is to analyze and hopefully predict based on the historical data to see whether Vancouver have any future snow storm patterns.
