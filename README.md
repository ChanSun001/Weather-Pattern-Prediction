# Weather-Pattern-Prediction
Due to 2022 snowstorm, this prompted me to think if this was one of the largest snowstorms in the history of my local city (Vancouver). <br />
Using past 5 years online weather dataset, I've created a cloud service data pipeline. <br />
AWS EMR with Spark and Hadoop, Pyspark script, and storing the logs in AWS S3 <br />
The goal is to analyze and hopefully predict based on the historical data to see whether Vancouver have any future snow storm patterns.
